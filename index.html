                       Illuminati was alot to handle as a puppy. He did not like crate training, so he was a free range dog.

                   <p>
                       My son and I knew we wanted another puppy after the passing of our pug and other mini Aussie. I promised Ethan we would get a dog and he could name him. After searching the internet for breeders, we found lazy Jays ranch in Missisppi, who delivered him to us in Fl, and 7 weeks old. Ethan came up with his name while in school at the lunch table.
